# Book Management System

A Book Management System built using **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL** as the database, and **Sequelize** as the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. This system allows for managing books, including functionalities like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving book details.

## Features
- Add new books to the system
- Update book details
- Delete books from the system
- List all books
- Search for books based on various criteria (e.g., title, author)

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routes and server-side logic
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database to store book details
- **Sequelize**: ORM for PostgreSQL that simplifies database interactions
